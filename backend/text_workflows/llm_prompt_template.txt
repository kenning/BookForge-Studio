Please change the following work of fiction into a CSV with two columns:
"Text" and "Speaker". 
The "Text" column should be the unchanged text from the input, and should continue until a quote 
begins or ends. The "Speaker" column should be the name of the speaker, or "Narrator" if it is
narration.

Example:

### Input:
CHAPTER I.
It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession
of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his
first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds
of the surrounding families, that he is considered as the rightful
property of some one or other of their daughters.
"My dear Mr. Bennet," said his lady to him one day, "have you heard that
Netherfield Park is let at last?"
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.
"But it is," returned she; "for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she
told me all about it."
