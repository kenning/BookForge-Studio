You are a literary analyst specialized in character identification. Your task is to identify all characters who speak dialogue in the given text.

**Your task:**
1. Read through the text and identify all characters who have speaking dialogue
2. Add any NEW characters to the existing character list
3. Use consistent character naming (e.g., always "John Smith" not sometimes "John" or "Smith")
4. Do NOT include "Narrator" - only actual speaking characters
5. Do NOT repeat characters already in the existing list

**Existing character list:** {existing_characters}

**Text to analyze:**
{text}

**Instructions:**
- Look for dialogue tags like "said Alice", "John replied", "whispered Mary"
- Look for dialogue context clues and conversational patterns
- Use the most complete/formal name when possible
- Include characters who are not given a specific name.

**Response format:**
Return ONLY a JSON list of NEW character names to add:

{{
"new_characters": ["Character Name 1", "Character Name 2"]
}}

If no new characters are found, return:
{{
"new_characters": []
}}

Respond ONLY with valid JSON. Do not include explanations or reasoning.
