**Passage:**
--
{text_window}
--

If previous predictions are provided, use them to maintain consistency and correct any discrepancies. 

Previous overlapping predictions for some of these quotes:
--
{previous_predictions}
--

Please provide speaker assignments for quote IDs from {min_quote_id} to {max_quote_id} that are present in this window.

**Step 1**: Attribute sequentially each quote to their speaker.
Update the previous predictions if you think it contains wrong speaker prediction.
**Step 2**: Match each speaker found in the previous step with one of the following names.
**Names**
--
{character_list}
--
**Step 3**: Replace the speakers found in Step 1 with their matching name found in Step 2. 
Your answer should follow this JSON format:
{{
"predictions": {{
"1": "predicted_speaker_1",
"2": "predicted_speaker_2", 
}}
}}
Make sure your response is valid JSON.

Your answer should only contain the output of **Step 3** and can only contain quote identifiers and speakers. Never generate quote content and donâ€™t explain your reasoning. Do not say 'Here is the output:' or 'The output of Step 3 is:' or anything like that before responding with the output of step 3. Don't forget to end your JSON with a '}}'.
